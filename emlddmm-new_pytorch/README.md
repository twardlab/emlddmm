# EMLDDMM
Expectation Maximization Large Deformation Diffeomorphic Metric Mapping is an image registration method for aligning datasets in the presence of differing contrast profiles and missing tissue or artifacts.

It uses an expectation maximization algorithm (EM) [ref] to handle missing data, and leverages the powerful Large Deformation Diffeomorphic Metric Mapping (LDDMM) paradaigm [ref] to ensure mappings are diffeomorphisms [ref], and are generated in a Reimannian framework suitable for statistical analysis [ref].

These concepts were brought together into the EMLDDMM algorithm described in  [ref,ref].
