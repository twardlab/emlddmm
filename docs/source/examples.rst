Examples
========

We include two worked examples in our github repository under the examples folder.  
In both cases we include an interactive approach that inclues several visualizations, in the form of a jupyter notebook.
At the end of each jupyter notebook we show how the same analysis can be run from the command line, using our transformation graph interface, producing our standard output format.

The first describes 3D registration between two human MRI datasets.  The second describes 3D to 2D registration between the Allen Nissl atlas, and a sequence of Nissl stained images.

Note that our command line interface has only been validated on Linux systems.
