    ''' Apply Transformation

    Applies affine matrix and velocity field transforms to map source points to target points. Saves displacement field from source points to target points
    (i.e. difference between transformed coordinates and input coordinates), and determinant of Jacobian for 3d source spaces. Also saves transformed image in vtk format.

    Parameters
    ----------
    graph : emlddmm Graph object
    out: str
        path to registration outputs parent directory
    I : emlddmm Image   
    target_space : str
        name of the space to which image I will be transformed.
    target_fnames : list
        list of file names; only necessary if target is a series of 2d slices.
        
    TODO
    ----
    Check why the registered space histology is not working. (march 27, 2023)
    I think the issue is that there is actually no time to do it.
    If I say to reconstruct one space to itself, then it says not connected and gives an error.  
    There needs to be another way.
